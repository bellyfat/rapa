stream audio from localhost to target server
server, as it implies, already has the socket server running and ready to play audio as data is recieved

referenced brautopy
record audio from browser mic
process audio in javascript
opus wrapper and libopus in javascript
all audio processing (encoding) is done by browser
data is then sent to server and server will decode and play it accordingly

UI was created to get list of audio devices, but real functionality is not yet done

found out server is playing low quality audio
when compared to running native python script to do recording, encoding and sending

created audio recording consumer
a problem here is that the audio recording process needs to send out the audio packet asynchronously
but a forked process will have a different virtual memory
it's not trivial to attach a socket to another process
also, the socket consumer is running in the server process so it cannot block
thus to send the audio packet asynchronously, another thread is created

created a local socket consumer
browser will connect to local socket
recieve data from local socket
pipe data to external server socket without any processing
the throughput is a concern
packets lost is getting frequent
processing power is high
but it works

written UI to configure audio devices
decided to send configuration through socket instead of using REST API
socket will be kept open once connected
